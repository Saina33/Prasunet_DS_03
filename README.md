# Sentiment Analysis and Visualization Project
## Overview

This repository contains the work I completed for Task 3 of my internship at Prasunet Company. The project focuses on analyzing and visualizing sentiment patterns in social media data to understand public opinion and attitudes towards specific topics or brands using Power BI.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis includes the following columns:
- `reviewerID`: Unique identifier for each reviewer
- `asin`: Product identifier
- `reviewerName`: Name of the reviewer
- `helpful`: Helpful votes for the review
- `reviewText`: Text of the review
- `overall`: Rating out of 5
- `summary`: Summary of the review
- `unixReviewTime`: Review time in Unix timestamp
- `reviewTime`: Review time in dd/mm/yyyy format
- `sentimental score`: Sentiment score of the review

## Dashboard Features
The Power BI dashboard created for this project includes:
- **Slicer**: Allows users to filter reviews by product ASIN.
- **Pie Chart**: Displays the distribution of sentiments (positive, negative, neutral).
- **Line Chart**: Shows sentiment trends over time.
- **Bar Graph**: Illustrates sentiment distribution by product.
- **Scatter Plot**: Plots sentiment score against overall rating.

## Key Insights
1. **Sentiment Distribution**: The pie chart provides an at-a-glance view of overall sentiment distribution across all products.
2. **Trends Over Time**: The line chart helps track how sentiment has changed over the review period.
3. **Product Comparison**: The bar graph enables comparison of sentiment across different products.
4. **Rating Correlation**: The scatter plot highlights the relationship between sentiment scores and product ratings.

## Learning Outcomes
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Enhanced my skills in analyzing sentiment patterns in social media data.
- **Data Visualization**: Improved my ability to create interactive and insightful visualizations using Power BI.
- **Dashboard Development**: Developed a comprehensive dashboard that facilitates dynamic data exploration.

## Conclusion
This project has significantly improved my capabilities in sentiment analysis and data visualization, equipping me with valuable skills for future data-driven projects. I look forward to applying these skills to further tasks at Prasunet Company.

Special thanks to Prasunet Company for providing the opportunity to work on this project.
